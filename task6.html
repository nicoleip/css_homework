				<p class="text_black"> As in the 2 column exercise, the color change is detectible where the div 
			    meets the .jpg background. I used the same hexidecimal number in the PS doc as was used in the HTML?
			    <br>
			    <br>
			    <br>
			    This exercise uses a main wrapper background as one fixed strip. I get serious Float Drop when I resize
			    (reduce) the browser window. I think that "display:inline; /* stops IE doubling margin on float" is for, 
			    but would like further explanantion to understand the comment.
			    <br>
			    <br>
			    <br>
			    Is keeping the #wrapper div necessary in a stylesheet? If there is also going to be separate version wrappers 
			    as we have here to contain the different background images? Or perhaps this is an example of an inner div as the 
			    book suggests? I am still confused on that detail.
			    <br>
			    <br>
			    <br>
			    Even though I have auto margin sets on the wrapper, but the "clear" seems to be allowing it outside.
			    However, when I remmove the clear, it hugs the bottom of the header?
